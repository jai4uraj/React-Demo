# Conway's Game of Life Kata #

From [TDD & Conway's Game of Life](http://jeremybytes.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/tdd-conways-game-of-life.html).

Implement these rules for Conway's Game of Life:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
